# Case Study 01: From Mannequin-Like Outputs to Soulful Portraits

**Status:** Retrospective qualitative case study  
**Evidence type:** Personal observations across creative workflows  
**Scope:** Realistic human image generation, prompt interpretation, and visible creative characteristics

## 1. Research Question

Why can an AI image generator produce realistic human figures that still feel emotionally flat, while carefully structured instructions can produce results that appear more expressive, natural, and soulful?

A second question emerged from repeated creative work: how much of the result comes from the image generator itself, and how much may come from the way a chatbot interprets and restructures the user's request before image generation?

## 2. Context

These observations come from practical creative work involving realistic human characters and portrait generation. The objective was not merely to create technically realistic faces, but to preserve character identity, natural expression, emotional presence, and the intended artistic direction.

The observations are retrospective. Original prompts, model versions, settings, and matched output samples were not consistently recorded, so the findings should not be treated as the results of a controlled benchmark.

## 3. Observations

### 3.1 Nano Banana: The Importance of Structured Direction

In my experience, Nano Banana can produce human figures that feel mannequin-like when the instructions are insufficiently precise.

More carefully structured prompts can produce results that feel more natural and emotionally expressive. This suggests that the specificity and organization of creative direction may be important factors in the outcome.

This is a personal observation, not a claim that Nano Banana always behaves this way.

### 3.2 Chatbot-Mediated Image Generation

I observed that using Nano Banana through the Gemini chatbot could produce strong results.

One possible explanation is that the chatbot interprets and reconstructs the user's request into more structured instructions before passing them to the image-generation system.

I have noticed a comparable possibility in GPT image-generation workflows, where a natural-language request may be internally transformed into more structured instructions before the image is generated.

The exact internal processing is not directly visible to me. Therefore, prompt restructuring is a working hypothesis, not a verified explanation of the systems' internal mechanisms.

### 3.3 Seedream: Positive Results, Limited Documentation

I have also used Seedream and found its results good. My general impression is that some of its behavior resembles my experience with Nano Banana.

However, I have not documented enough specific examples to identify a reliable, distinctive pattern. No stronger conclusion is made here.

### 3.4 Grok: Changes in Prompt Visibility

In an earlier workflow, Grok displayed the image-generation prompt in the conversation. I also experienced a workflow in which the prompt could be reviewed before generation. The generated image could additionally display its prompt beneath the result.

In my more recent experience, Grok no longer displays the prompt in the interface as it did previously.

This is a retrospective observation about a change in my user experience. It does not establish when the change occurred, whether it applies to every version, or whether the underlying prompt-generation process itself changed.

The distinction matters: a prompt becoming less visible to the user does not necessarily mean that prompt construction has stopped occurring.

## 4. Emerging Interpretation: Model Behavior vs. Prompt Mediation

These experiences suggest two different factors worth investigating.

**Model behavior** refers to recurring tendencies in the image generator's outputs, including how it handles realism, expression, character details, and creative constraints.

**Prompt mediation** refers to the interpretation, restructuring, or expansion of a user's request by an interface, chatbot, or intermediate system before generation.

These factors can be confused when two workflows use what appears to be the same image model but produce different results.

A better result from a chatbot-mediated workflow does not, by itself, prove that the underlying image model has improved. The input reaching the generator may also differ.

## 5. Main Insight

An AI image generator's practical creative fingerprint may appear not only in what it produces, but also in what it struggles to preserve and how sensitive its results are to the structure of the instructions.

At the same time, the observable result may reflect more than the image model alone. The surrounding workflow and the interpretation of the user's intent may also contribute.

For realistic human generation, technical realism and emotional believability should be evaluated separately.

## 6. Limitations

- The observations are based on personal creative experience.
- The examples were not collected under standardized conditions.
- Original prompts and model versions were not consistently recorded.
- No controlled comparison isolates chatbot-mediated prompts from directly submitted prompts.
- Terms such as "soulful" and "mannequin-like" describe subjective visual judgments and require clearer evaluation criteria for formal testing.
- Changes in interface behavior do not establish changes in the underlying model.

## 7. Next Research Direction

A future experiment could compare the same creative request in two workflows:

1. A directly submitted prompt.
2. A chatbot-mediated request that may restructure the prompt.

The outputs could then be evaluated using consistent criteria: natural expression, emotional believability, character consistency, and adherence to the requested details.

The purpose would be to investigate the role of prompt mediation rather than assume its effect in advance.

## 8. Conclusion

These retrospective observations provide a starting point for investigating the relationship between prompt structure, image-generation behavior, and emotional expressiveness.

They do not establish a universal ranking of generators or prove a specific internal mechanism. Instead, they identify a practical question worth testing: when an AI-generated person feels more alive, what part of the workflow helped make that difference?

**Working principle:** Observe the output. Separate the model from the workflow. Test before generalizing.
